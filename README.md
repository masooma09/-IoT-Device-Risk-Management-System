# 🔐 IoT Risk Assessment & Role-Based Access Control System

A Python-based simulation project that implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), dynamic risk assessment, and automated security recommendations for IoT devices. The system evaluates device risks based on firmware versions, device types, and update history. It supports secure user roles, generates detailed risk reports, and allows managers to approve recommended actions.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ IoT Device Risk Evaluation
  - Calculates risk based on device type and firmware version
  - Adjusts risk dynamically depending on last update time
  - Adds a random risk factor for unpredictability

- 🔐 RBAC - Role-Based Access Control
  - Viewer: Can view reports
  - Manager: Can view reports, approve recommendations
  - Admin: Full access (add devices, modify reports)

- 📄 Risk Reports & Recommendations
  - Add/view recommendations
  - Track approval status
  - Display current risk levels of all devices

- 📊 Advanced Statistics
  - Count of devices by status (Active, Inactive, Maintenance)
  - Count of devices by risk level (High, Low)
